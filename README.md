# Glaucomo_Detection
The Glaucoma Detection project utilizes computer vision and convolutioal neural networks in deep learning to identify glaucoma, a disease that can lead to blindness. By applying advanced image processing techniques, the project analyzes optic nerve features for early detection.

This project uses multiple datasets, including:

Drishti-GS (101 images)
RIM-ONE DL
ACRIMA
The goal is to develop an automated system for faster and more accurate glaucoma diagnosis, aiding early intervention and treatment.
