# Glaucomo_Detection
The Glaucoma Detection project uses computer vision and the Drishti-GS dataset (101 images) to identify glaucoma, a disease that can cause blindness. By applying image processing and deep learning, the project analyzes optic nerve features to detect glaucoma early. The goal is to develop an automated system for faster and more accurate diagnosis.
